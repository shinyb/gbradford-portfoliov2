               <p class="site-text"> My assignment was to create a program to donate gas cards to local cancer patients, and its primary fundraiser would be the Cancer Awareness Banquet. I named the program Fill-up for Hope and made contact with the local cancer institute. The institute agreed to distribute the cards to its patients. I contacted local businesses who became sponsors and donated products for the fundraiser. I designed, wrote the context, and code for the website. The initial graphic design was done using Adobe XD. The website is also responsive.</p>

            <p>I started in the tech field many years ago while working as an executive assistant to the Chief Information Officer. The CIO encouraged me to take IT courses and allowed me to use the newly learned skills on the job. First I learned to build computers, then desktop support, then software training, then databases, and so on. This fusion of tech and administrative skills has been a great benefit to me over the years.  Though it may appear that I am exploring a new field; it is more accurate to say that I am continuing to expand my knowledge in Information Technology. For me, expanding into web development and desktop publishing are a natural progression and fit well with my background and my innate desire to continually learn new things.</p>
